[definition]xp - Extreme Programming, concept, that appeared in 1990, claims that client will always get what he/she wants (also in case if terms of references must be changed).
XP is based on set of specific rules, and most people prefer using and adapting only a part of them for their needs.
Some of XP' rules:
1. Modify versions a little but do it often
2. Follow step by step loop developing
3. Do not add elements, that are not in term of reference
4. Write test code first
5. Keep it simple
6. Practice pair programing. That will allow developers to know everything about code

If there is a choice between for and while choose while when you know clear amount of the loop iterations

[func]Integer.parseInt() - allows to get int from string
[func]Math.random() - returns double
