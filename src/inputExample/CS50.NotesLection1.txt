computer science = input data + output data

CS - study of information, how do you represent it and how do you process it -> computational thinking - an application
RAM - random access memory

in this terms, problems solving looks like this:

          ____________
input -> | algorithm  | -> output
         |____________|

unary - a system, that use one symbol to count things (base-1)
binary - a system, that use two digits (base-2)
bit goes from binary digit (bit is just a zero and one, it is a binary digit)
the decimal system is mostly used by humans (where the dec means ten) (base-10)
transistors = switchers

10^2  10^1 10^0

2^2    2^1  2^0

 4      2    1

 #      #    #

 0      0    0

byte = 8 bites

A = 65 

ASCII - american standart code for information interchange (matching numbers and letters)

number are stored on the other numbers

Unicode - also mapping numbers to letters

Concerning emojies:
first byte represents the structure of the emoji + reusable pattern

RGB - red green blue
each colour of the pixel contains 3 bytes (with amount less or equal 255)

FPS - frames per second

Abstraction - the simplicifaction of something

Pseudocode. Example:

1. Pick up phone book
2. Open to middle of phone book
3. Look at page
4. If person is on page
5.    Call person
6. Else if person is earlier in book
7.    Open to middle of left half of book
8.    Go to line 3
9. Else if person is later in book
10.    Open to middle of right half of book
11.    Go to line 3
12. Else
13.    Quit

Actions/verbs = functions (+ arguments, return values)
Else/if/else if = conditions
what goes after conditions = boolean expressions (just a question with yes/no)
Go to = loops

Scratch - graphical programming language

Sprites are interactive objects, who must repond to events, not just images
